# 🎓 UK International Student and Dependant Visa Trends Dashboard

This project explores UK migration trends for international students and their dependants using official **GOV.UK immigration data (2019–2023)**.  
It visualises visa issuance patterns, nationality distributions, and student–dependent relationships through **interactive dashboards and data visualisations**.

## 📊 Key Features
- Cleaned and structured GOV.UK visa datasets for reproducible analysis  
- Insightful visualisations: time series, flow maps, and comparative trend charts  
- Interactive **Streamlit dashboard** for real-time data exploration  
- Designed for clarity and impact — aligned with UK data-science portfolio standards  

## 🧠 Technologies
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
- Streamlit (for dashboard interactivity)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub for version control

## 📂 Repository Structure
- data/ → cleaned dataset
- notebooks/ → analysis notebooks
- plots/ → exported visualisations
- Data Visualization Portfolio Streamlit Dashboard.ipynb → dashboard notebook
  
## 🚀 Run the Dashboard Locally
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run "Data Visualization Portfolio Streamlit Dashboard.ipynb"
```
## 📈 Results & Insights
- 📊 A steady rise in **student visa issuances** was observed post-pandemic, especially for dependants of postgraduate students.  
- 🌍 **India, China, and Nigeria** lead in student visa numbers, with notable increases in dependants from South Asia.  
- 🧾 Dependants now represent a significant share of total student-related visas, reflecting evolving migration and education policies.  
- 🕵️‍♀️ These insights support evidence-based policy discussions on international education and post-study work opportunities.
